# ✅ YOUR WORKING FILES ARE RESTORED!

## 🎉 **WHAT I DID:**

I extracted your **original working `files__1_.zip`** and made **ONLY ONE CHANGE**:

### **The Fix:**
```
Line 457 in index.html:
Changed: <script src="app-professional.js"></script>
To:      <script src="app-professional-firebase.js"></script>
```

**That's it!** Everything else is EXACTLY as you had it before.

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS WRONG:**

Your `index.html` was looking for `app-professional.js` but the file is named `app-professional-firebase.js`.

That caused a 404 error and prevented the dashboard from loading.

**Now fixed!** ✅
